## How It's Made:

**Tech used:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript, React, Express, Node, and MongoDB.

In this project I created a login and register page for users to login to. I included different categories of food and nutrition. I also created a fake newsletter for users to sign up for. Finally, I created a checkout system that lets the user buy and purchase their food and gives them an estimated wait time.

## Optimizations

I added some images and and certain colors to make the application more user friendly. I also helped make sure the text and categories easy to see and understand for the customer. I also tried to use as much simple and clean code as possible to ensure my application runs smoothly. 

## Lessons Learned:

For this application I learned how to to use JWT Authentication and Authorization and how to structure it correctly in my backend.
From my client I learned how to use the Redux tool kit and Redux persist, how to use JWT token for API calls, and I also learned more about how flex layouts work.
This is my largest project that helped me focus on my react skills and development.
